  Terraform can store state remotely in OSS and lock that state with OSS.

# OSS

**Kind: Standard (with locking via TableStore)**

Stores the state as a given key in a given bucket on Stores
[Alibaba Cloud OSS](https://www.alibabacloud.com/help/product/31815.htm).
This backend also supports state locking and consistency checking via
[Alibaba Cloud Table Store](https://www.alibabacloud.com/help/doc-detail/27280.htm), which can be enabled by setting
the `tablestore_table` field to an existing TableStore table name.

## Example Configuration

```hcl
terraform {
  backend "oss" {
    bucket = "bucket-for-terraform-state"
    prefix   = "path/mystate"
    key   = "version-1.tfstate"
    region = "cn-beijing"
    tablestore_endpoint = "https://terraform-remote.cn-hangzhou.ots.aliyuncs.com"
    tablestore_table = "statelock"
  }
}
```

This assumes we have a [OSS Bucket](https://www.terraform.io/docs/providers/alicloud/r/oss_bucket.html) created called `bucket-for-terraform-state`,
a [OTS Instance](https://www.terraform.io/docs/providers/alicloud/r/ots_instance.html) called `terraform-remote` and
a [OTS TableStore](https://www.terraform.io/docs/providers/alicloud/r/ots_table.html) called `statelock`. The
Terraform state will be written into the file `path/mystate/version-1.tfstate`.


## Using the OSS remote state

To make use of the OSS remote state we can use the
[`terraform_remote_state` data
source](/docs/providers/terraform/d/remote_state.html).

```hcl
terraform {
  backend "oss" {
    bucket = "remote-state-dns"
    prefix = "mystate/state"
    key    = "terraform.tfstate"
    region = "cn-beijing"
  }
}
```

The `terraform_remote_state` data source will return all of the root outputs
defined in the referenced remote state, an example output might look like:

```
data "terraform_remote_state" "network" {
    backend   = "oss"
    config    = {
        bucket = "remote-state-dns"
        key    = "terraform.tfstate"
        prefix = "mystate/state"
        region = "cn-beijing"
    }
    outputs   = {}
    workspace = "default"
}
```

## Configuration variables

The following configuration options or environment variables are supported:

 * `access_key` - (Optional) Alibaba Cloud access key. It supports environment variables `ALICLOUD_ACCESS_KEY` and  `ALICLOUD_ACCESS_KEY_ID`.
 * `secret_key` - (Optional) Alibaba Cloud secret access key. It supports environment variables `ALICLOUD_SECRET_KEY` and  `ALICLOUD_ACCESS_KEY_SECRET`.
 * `security_token` - (Optional) STS access token. It supports environment variable `ALICLOUD_SECURITY_TOKEN`.
 * `region` - (Optional) The region of the OSS bucket. It supports environment variables `ALICLOUD_REGION` and `ALICLOUD_DEFAULT_REGION`.
 * `endpoint` - (Optional) A custom endpoint for the OSS API. It supports environment variables `ALICLOUD_OSS_ENDPOINT` and `OSS_ENDPOINT`.
 * `bucket` - (Required) The name of the OSS bucket.
 * `prefix` - (Opeional) The path directory of the state file will be stored. Default to "env:".
 * `key` - (Optional) The name of the state file. Defaults to `terraform.tfstate`.
 * `tablestore_endpoint` / `ALICLOUD_TABLESTORE_ENDPOINT` - (Optional) A custom endpoint for the TableStore API.
 * `tablestore_table` - (Optional) A TableStore table for state locking and consistency.
 * `encrypt` - (Optional) Whether to enable server side
   encryption of the state file. If it is true, OSS will use 'AES256' encryption algorithm to encrypt state file.
 * `acl` - (Optional) [Object
   ACL](https://www.alibabacloud.com/help/doc-detail/52284.htm)
   to be applied to the state file.
 * `assume_role` - (Optional) If provided with a role ARN, will attempt to assume this role using the supplied credentials.
 
The nested `assume_role` block supports the following:
* `role_arn` - (Required) The ARN of the role to assume. If ARN is set to an empty string, it does not perform role switching. It supports environment variable `ALICLOUD_ASSUME_ROLE_ARN`.
  Terraform executes configuration on account with provided credentials.

* `policy` - (Optional) A more restrictive policy to apply to the temporary credentials. This gives you a way to further restrict the permissions for the resulting temporary
  security credentials. You cannot use the passed policy to grant permissions that are in excess of those allowed by the access policy of the role that is being assumed.

* `session_name` - (Optional) The session name to use when assuming the role. If omitted, 'terraform' is passed to the AssumeRole call as session name. It supports environment variable `ALICLOUD_ASSUME_ROLE_SESSION_NAME`.

* `session_expiration` - (Optional) The time after which the established session for assuming role expires. Valid value range: [900-3600] seconds. Default to 3600 (in this case Alibaba Cloud use own default value). It supports environment variable `ALICLOUD_ASSUME_ROLE_SESSION_EXPIRATION`.

-> **Note:** If you want to store state in the custom OSS endpoint, you can specify a environment variable `OSS_ENDPOINT`, like "oss-cn-beijing-internal.aliyuncs.com"
